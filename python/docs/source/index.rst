Quanser Interactive Labs API Documentation
==========================================

**Welcome to the Quanser Interactive Labs documentation!**

This site contains documentation for the virtual environments inside of Quanser
Interactive Labs.  It will walk you through installation and setup as well as
documentation for how to customize your environment.

.. attention:: **Looking for Hardware Documentation?**
   If you are looking for courseware or other hardware documentation for using
   the physical studio (hardware) please check out the `website
   <https://www.quanser.com/products/self-driving-car-research-studio/>`_.

Design Philosophy
=================
The Quanser Interactive Labs API documentation has been currently designed for
python script tests.
Although there are some basic interface options, the current virtual Quanser
Interactive Labs (QLabs) is not designed to be used through the interface
alone. We therefore highly recommend that you follow along in our
:ref:`Get Started` page to get set up to run python scripts.  The python script
examples used throughout this documentation of the virtual QCar libraries will 
help you get used to our libraries and the capabilities of our workspaces.
