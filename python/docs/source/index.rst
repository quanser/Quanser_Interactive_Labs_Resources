Quanser Interactive Labs API Documentation
==========================================

**Welcome to the Quanser Interactive Labs documentation!**

This site contains documentation for the virtual environments inside of Quanser
Interactive Labs.  It will walk you through installation and setup as well as
documentation for how to customize your enviroment.

.. attention:: **Looking for Hardware Documentation?**
   If you are looking for courseware or other hardware documentation for using
   the physical studio (hardware) please check out the `website
   <https://www.quanser.com/products/self-driving-car-research-studio/>`_.

Design Philosophy
=================
The Quanser Interactive Labs API documentation has been currently designed for
python script tests.
Although there are some basic interface options, the current virtual Quanser
Interactive Labs (QLabs) is not designed to be used through the interface
alone. We therefore highly recommend that you try our simple
:ref:`Getting Started` to get started.  This python script uses
the virtual QCar libraries to help you get used to our libraries and the
capabilities of our workspaces.
