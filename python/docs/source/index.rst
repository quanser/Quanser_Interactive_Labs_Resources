Quanser's Self-Driving Car Virtual Studio Documentation
=======================================================

Welcome to the Self-Driving Car Studio Virtual Documentation! 

This site contains documentation for the Self-Driving Car Studio's Virtual Lab.
If you are looking for courseware for using the physical studio please check out the 
`website <https://www.quanser.com/products/self-driving-car-research-studio/>`_.

Design Philosophy 
=================
The Self-Driving Car Studio's Virtual Lab has been designed for python script tests.  
Although there are some basic interface options, the current Self-Driving Car Virtual Studio is not designed to be used through the interface alone.
We therefore highly recommend that you try our simple :ref:`Tutorial - Getting Started` to get started with python scripts for the Self-Driving Car Virtual Studio and get used to our libraries and the capabilities of our workspaces. 


Contributing
============
We are always striving to improve our documentation.  
You can help by submitting pull requests for fixes or issues for suggestions on our GitHub repository.
