Quanser's QCar Virtual Documentation
====================================

Welcome to the Virtual QCar Documentation! 

This site contains documentation for the virtual QCar documentation.
If you are looking for courseware for using the physical studio please check out the 
`website <https://www.quanser.com/products/self-driving-car-research-studio/>`_.

Design Philosophy 
=================
The virtual QCar documentation has been designed for python script tests.  
Although there are some basic interface options, the current virtual Quanser lab (QLabs) is not 
designed to be used through the interface alone. We therefore highly recommend that you try our 
simple :ref:`Tutorial - Getting Started` to get started with a python script that uses the virtual 
QCar libraries and get used to our libraries and the capabilities of our workspaces. 


Contributing
============
We are always striving to improve our documentation.  
You can help by submitting pull requests for fixes or issues for suggestions on our GitHub repository.  
See our :ref:`Code Style`` page for more information about how to contribute and our coding practices.
