Studio Navigation Area
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The navigation area is the area in which an actor can traverse. 
In other words a actor can freely walk around in this area unobstructed by 
barriers that are part of the Open World.

.. note:: 
    The navigation area only applies to traversable actors such as people, 
    animals, etc.
