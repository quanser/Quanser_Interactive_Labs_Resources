Workspaces in QLabs are specific virtual environments or lab modules.
This environment could either be an open world or a virtual lab space with a
more focused purpose. An Open World is a virtual world or map where the user
can move freely and create and place objects to create custom scenarios.
There are several different Open Worlds available in QLabs for different types
of products.
