    Self-Driving Car Studio (SDCS)
        The Self-Driving Car Studio is Quanser's autonomous vehicle research and development platform.   
     
    Quanser Interactive Labs (QLabs)
        QLabs or Quanser Interactive Labs is the virtual twin for Quanser's hardware products.
        Using Quanser Interactive Labs, you get a collection of virtual hardware-based laboratory 
        activities that supplement traditional or online courses. The virtual hardware is based 
        on Quanser physical systems and offers credible, academically appropriate experiences on 
        desktops, laptops, or smart devices. See more on our 
        `website <https://www.quanser.com/digital/quanser-interactive-labs/>`__.

    QCar
        The Quanser Virtual QCar is a fully instrumented, dynamically accurate digital twin of the 
        Quanser QCar system. It behaves the  same way as the physical hardware and can be measured 
        and controller using MATLAB/Simulink or Python development environments. It can enrich your 
        lectures and activities in traditional labs, or bring credible, authentic model-based lab 
        experiences into your distance and online self-driving course. Same as the physical QCar,  
        the virtual system is a self-driving teaching and research platform complete with 
        industrially relevant sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras.

    Open World
        In QLabs, an open world is a virtual world or map where the user can move freely and create 
        and place objects to create custom scenarios. There are several different Open Worlds 
        available in QLabs for different types of products. Please 
        `contact <https://www.quanser.com/contact/>`__ a Quanser representative to find out more.

    Actor
        In QLabs, an actor is any object that can be placed in the Open Worlds such as a camera,
        person, QCar, road signage, etc. Each actor class has different capabilities. 
        For a full list of actors, see the 
        :ref:`Python Actors Reference` for more details in controlling these actors in Python.
    
    Spawn
        Creating a new instance of an actor class is called spawning. 

    Configuration
        Some actors have more then one 3D animations called configurations. For instance, in the animal
        class, there is different configurations for different animals. See the configurations section 
        under the Actors Reference to see all configurations a particular actor class. 

    Connection Points
        Connection Points are points on an actor that other actors can be attached to. 

    Widget
        Widgets are a special class of highly performant actors. This allows thousands of dynamic 
        widgets can be spawned in the Open World, but they have the restriction that widgets cannot
        be addressed after they have been spawned.

    Reference Frame
        Reference Frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the 
        phenomenon under observation.

    Workspace
        A workspace in QLabs opens a specific virtual environment.  This environment could either be 
        an open world or a virtual lab space.
