Code Style
==========

Documentation style tests should be part of testing before new releases are made.

Python
------

Version
^^^^^^^

Python 3 will be used for development.

Style
^^^^^

We will use the `PEP8 guidelines <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ for code format.

We chose the following more precise rule where PEP 8 leaves some freedom:

* `We allow up to 100 characters per line (fifth paragraph) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length>`_.
* `We pick single quotes over double quotes as long as no escaping is necessary <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#string-quotes>`_.
* `We prefer hanging indents for continuation lines <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation>`_.


Markdown / reStructured Text
----------------------------

Style
^^^^^

The following standard to format text is intented to increase readability as well as versioning.

* *[.md, .rst only]* Each section title should be preceded by one empty line and succeeded by one empty line.

    * Rationale: It is easier to read to get an overview about the structure when screening the document.

* *[.rst only]* In restructured Text the headings should follow the hierarchy described in the `Sphinx style guide <'https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html#headings>`__:

    * ``#`` with overline (only once, used for the document title)
    * ``*`` with overline
    * ``=``
    * ``-``
    * ``^``
    * ``"``
    * Rationale: A consistent hierarchy expediites getting an idea about the nesting level when screening a document.

* *[.md only]* In Markdown the headings should follow the ATX-style described in the `Markdown syntax documentation <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header>`__

    * ATX-style headers use 1-6 hash characters (``#``) at the start of the line to denote header levels 1-6.
    * A space between the hases and the header title should be used (such as ``# Heading 1``) to make it easier to visually seperate them.
    * Justifiication for the ATX-style preference comes from the `Google Mardown style guide <https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/docguide/style.md#atx-style-headings>`__
    * Rationale: ATX-style headers are easier to search and maintain, and make the first two header levels consistent with the other levels.

* *[any]* Each sentence must start on a new line.

    * Rationale: For longer paragraphs a single change in the beginning makes the difference unreadable since it carries forward through the whole paragraph.

* *[any]* Each sentence can optionally be wrapped to keep each line short.
* *[any]* The lines should not have any trailing white spaces.
* *[.md, .rst only]* A code block must be preceded and succeeded by an empty line.

    * Rationale: Whitespace is significant only directly before and directly after fenced code blocks. Following these instructions will ensure that highlighting works properly and consistantly.

* *[.md, .rst only]* A code block should specify a syntax (e.g. ``bash``).
